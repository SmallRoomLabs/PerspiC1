#PerspiC 1 decoder

PerspiC 1 decoder is a 1-of-8 decoder sub-assembly implemented in Diode-Transistor Logic. Three of these are used in the PerspiC 1 RAM board (one for the write bus and one each for the two read ports).

The decoder is similar in function to the 74LS138 1-of-8 decoder, although the PerspiC 1 decoder also provides active high as well as the active low outputs and is missing the active high enable input. All up, the PerspiC 1 decoder has 25 pins, including 2 each of GND and Vcc and the pins are arranged in single-inline format (SIP).
