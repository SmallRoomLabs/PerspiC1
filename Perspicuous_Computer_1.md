# Perspicuous Computer 1
Perspicuous Computer 1 is a demonstration computer built entirely from discrete components, as opposed to integrated circuits. All hardware and firmware etc. is completely visible to the human eye, and hence can be audited and examined.

## Technology
In particular, Perspicuous Computer 1 will be built from NPN Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) wired up using Diode-Transistor Logic and made to be compatible with Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL).
PerspiC 1 will be built on 100mm x 160mm Eurocard PCBs with 64-pin DIN 41612 connectors, wire-wrapped on the back plane.
All parts of PerspiC 1 will be designed using total Free and Open Source Software applications, such as PCB and the GNU Electronic Design Automation (gEDA) tools.
Note that the Apollo Guidance Computer, used to land man on the moon, was fabricated entirely with 3-input NOR gates (fabricated on ICs, not discrete transistors)

## Advantages
- Educational
- Visible - all parts are easy to see, even when in full operation
- Auditable - due to visibility and ability to verify individual functions, the computer hardware can be audited
- Testable - there are no signals which are not exposed, and hence able to be probed
- Modifiable - easi(er) to modify functionality as required

## Disadvantages
- Slow - up to 4 orders of magnitude, or more, slower than advanced ICs
- Bulky - uses up significant space
- Expensive - to build
- Power hungry - uses orders of magnitude more energy per operation than advanced ICs
- Heavy

## Sub-systems

Perspicuous Computer 1 will consist of:
- a CPU, such as PerspiC 1 BF CPU
- PerspiC 1 RAM (data storage)
- PerspiC 1 ROM (program storage)
- PerspiC 1 Secondary Storage
- PerspiC 1 I/O system
